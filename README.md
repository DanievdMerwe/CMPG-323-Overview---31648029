# Branching strategy to be used with each project:
I will be using the same branching strategy throughout all of my projects. These will consist of:

* Main
* Develop branch 

These branches will allow for all and any modification that might need to be made to the project, and if there is needed, I will create another branch. 

# The use of a .gitignore file within each project:

.gitignore tells Git which files need to be ignored when you commit your project to the GitHub repository.

Project 1 - We will not be using a .gitignore file for project 1

Project 2 - I did not use a .gitignore file for project 2
